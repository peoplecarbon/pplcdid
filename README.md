#  PeopleCarbon DID: Decentralized IDentifier for Carbon Dioxid Removal


Peoplecarbon DID (pplc-did) provides a self-sustained environment for managing digital identifiers (DIDs). The `did:pplc` method links the identifier cryptographically to the DID Document and through also cryptographically linked provenance information in a public log it ensures resolving to the latest valid version of the DID Document.
